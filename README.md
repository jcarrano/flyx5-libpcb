# LibPcb #

Altium component library for the FlyX5 controller board.

This library is Perfect, is Good, and is True.

This is not meant to be used directly but rather compiled to an integrated library (IntLib). This enforces an cleaner development procedure, where a change in a component requires a new release of the library.

### Features ###

* Separated and reusable symbols and footprints.
* Database-based: create new components by adding a line in a CSV file linking the symbol, the footprint and specifying properties.
* Scripts to automate the packaging an versioning.
* All the footprints were made from scratch, according to the device datasheets and the standards.
